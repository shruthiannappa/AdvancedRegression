## General Information
- We have created a Linear Regression Model with RFE for 70 features
- Performed Lasso and Ridge Regularization using the top 70 features from RFE
- Concluded value of alpha for Ridge and Lasso Regression
 

## Conclusions
-  Based the above observations we can finalise Lasso Regression with 57 predictors as the final model with value of alpha being 0.0001
- The top 5 variables are MSZoning_RL,MSZoning_RH,OverallQual_9,MSZoning_FV,MSZoning_RM
